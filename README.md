# Organo

## About the Project

Organo is a project developed in React, based on the introductory React lessons from Alura in partnership with the Oracle Next Education (ONE) program. The goal of the project was to learn basic React concepts such as npm, components, the virtual DOM, and conditional rendering while building an application from scratch.

## Features

Organo is a team organization application that allows users to customize teams and team members according to their needs. With the help of forms, users can add new team members and create teams while also customizing the colors of each team. The application also includes features for favoriting and removing team members dynamically.

Since I do not have a real team to organize, I decided to have fun by using characters from Animal Crossing - New Horizons, a charming Nintendo game.
